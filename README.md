Predicting score of NBA players using K-Nearest-Neighbors

- Here are some selected columns from the data:  
-- player - name of the player  
-- pos - the position of the player  
-- g - number of games the player was in  
-- gs - number of games the player started  
-- pts - total points the player scored  

- The data was analysed and processed by dropping the columns which were not required. Then the fields were normalized. 
- The training set consists 70% of the data based on random selection. The rest was used as test data. 
- After refining the data, KNN model was trained using Sklearn Library.
